# eCommerce App

This is a work in progress. The front end for the header and footer is set up and ready for the next steps. Hero slider, product lists, additional pages all need refactoring.

As of May 12, 2022, have to pause this project and plan to return to it when my schedule is not so busy.

## Development Phases

This project is being developed in several phases:

### `API Front End`

Initial phase where the UI/UX is developed

Technologies
- Styled Components
- React/JSX

Components
- Navbar
- Hero Slider
- Product List UI
- Shopping Categories
- Login & Register Page
- Single Product Page

- Footer

### `eCommerce Backend`

During this phase of the project, I will build out the backend scaffolding.\
This will be an eCommerse Rest API using Nodejs and Mongo DB. I'll code NodeJS CRUD operations, fetch data with queries, and use advanced MongoDB methods.

To provide security, I will implement JSON Webtoken (JWT) by user and admin requests. For payments I will implement Stripe payment methods.

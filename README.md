# eCommerce App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development Phases

This project is being developed in several phases:

### `API Front End`

Initial phase where the UI/UX is developed

Technologies
- Styled Components
- React/JSX

Components
- Navbar
- Hero Slider
- Product List UI
- Shopping Categories
- Login & Register Page
- Single Product Page
- Shopping Cart Page
- Footer

### `eCommerce Backend`

During this phase of the project, I will build out the backend scaffolding.\
This will be an eCommerse Rest API using Nodejs and Mongo DB. I'll code NodeJS CRUD operations, fetch data with queries, and use advanced MongoDB methods.

To provide security, I will implement JSON Webtoken (JWT) by user and admin requests. For payments I will implement Stripe payment methods.


### `Add Additional Functionality`

Technologies
- React Router
- Fetch and Filter Products
- Redux Shopping Cart
- Stripe Payments
- Firebase Images

Components
- Admin Dashboard


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
